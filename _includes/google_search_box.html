Implement a Search box
First, create a file named my_google_search.html in the _includes folder in your jekyll website directory. Add this code to the newly created html file

<script language="Javascript" type="text/javascript">
  function my_search_google()
  {
    var query = document.getElementById("my-google-search").value;
    window.open("http://google.com/search?q=" + query
	+ "%20site:" + "http://yoursite.com");
  }
</script>
Replace http://yoursite.com with the URL of your site.

Next, open up your template file (usually /_includes/themes/theme-name/default.html), add this line in the head area.

<!-- my custom google search -->
{% include my_google_search.html %}
Finally, add a form where you want the search box to appear

<!-- my custom google search -->
<form onsubmit="my_search_google()" >
  <input type="text" id="my-google-search">
</form>
Ok, now youâ€™re done ;)

Actually this is a very simple Google search box that can be applied for any site not just Jekyll. Simply create a form in your page and include the script in the js file and Google will do the rest for you.
